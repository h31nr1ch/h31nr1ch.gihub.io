        <p> In some short words and topics I present the works that I most enjoy over the years. This page it's quite recent and I hope that over time more projects could be presented here. Some of this project I work alone, others with my friends, that I will always be grateful.</p>

        <h2>Current Projects </h2>

        <h2>Honeypot </h2>
        <p> Over the years I've worked on honeypots, aiming to undeastand how DDoS and DRDoS attacks are exploiting infected hosts. Some results can be found in the topic <a href="https://h31nr1ch.github.io/web/honey/index.html">Honeypot</a> and others will be presented during the time. I also used honeypots to identify attacks on a local network. </p>

        <h2> Presentations </h2>

        <h6>(2018) The power of Bots on the Internet:</h6> Botnets are present on the Internet, being responsible for carrying out varied activities among them it is possible to highlight attacks, interaction with users or web pages. The wide use and practicality to deploy these resources end up contributing to some malicious activities. In relation to this scope will be a discussion about botnets and presenting a bot that aims to perform some of the features that will be discussed (interaction with users and attacking web pages) <a href="https://youtu.be/pevuiTg2pAw"> (Youtube link).</a>
        <br>
        <h6>(2018) Darknet (... DeepWeb) and its importance for defense against espionage:</h6> Contextualization about the area and definition of some basic concepts for the understanding of the subject.

        <h6>(2018) Characterization and Evolution of Malicious Traffic Observed in a DNS Honeypot:</h6>
The presentation can be found in <a href="https://gtergts.nic.br/files/apresentacao/arquivo/222/02-honeypot.pdf">presentation link.</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/js1sm2-_A_U">Youtube link.</a> or [GTS 31] Caracterização e Evolução do Tráfego Malicioso Observado em um Honeypot DNS from chanel nicbrvideos.

        <br>
        <h6>(2018) The Secret about Network Mapping:</h6> To perform some types of attacks on hosts the first step to be performed is to identify and classify a victim, in this way two objectives will be addressed by the mini-course. The first objective is to teach how to identify vulnerability and tasks in an operating system and the second stage of the mini-course that is to exploit these vulnerabilities to perform attacks, which will be presented and performed by the participants. The attacks will be carried out on two hosts (Linux and Windows) to exploit the diversity of systems that can be found on a network. The set of tools and vulnerabilities will be presented during the course of the mini-course.
        <br>
        <h6>(2017) DDoS != ‘Dog Day of Summer’:</h6> Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are increasingly frequent, and it is difficult to find users who, when performing any online service did not suffered with the attacks <a href="https://youtu.be/X7flm_fumbg?list=PLPD6yHtp2G6InsdyLCLhgvD41izOnBSAK"> (Youtube link).</a>
